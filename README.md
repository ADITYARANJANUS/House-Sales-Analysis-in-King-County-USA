# Description: 

As a Data Analyst employed by a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), your primary responsibility is to analyze and predict residential housing prices. The REIT aims to make informed investment decisions in the residential real estate market by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Objective:

To determine the market price of a house based on a set of features. This involves analyzing various attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and other relevant factors that contribute to housing prices.


# Key Responsibilities:

1) Data Collection and Cleaning:

Gather data from various sources such as real estate databases, public records, and other relevant datasets.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, handling missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization:

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
Utilize data visualization techniques to create insightful visualizations such as box plots, reg plots.
Visualize key features and their impact on housing prices to identify trends and patterns.

3) Feature Engineering:

Identify and select relevant features that are likely to influence housing prices.
Create new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful insights.

4) Model Building:

Develop predictive models to estimate housing prices based on the selected features.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression.
Assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as R-squared (R^2) to measure the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Explore correlations between features and target variable using correlation analysis to identify strong predictors.

5) Ridge Regression:

Implement ridge regression, a regularization technique, to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.
Tune hyperparameters such as regularization strength (alpha) to optimize model performance.

6) Model Evaluation and Validation:

Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Validate the models using techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

7) Deployment and Reporting:

Deploy the trained models into production environments for real-time predictions or decision support.
Prepare comprehensive reports and presentations to communicate findings, insights, and recommendations to stakeholders within the REIT.
